# OO Principles #
1. Encapsulate what varies.
2. Code to an interface rather than to an implementation.
3. Each class in your application should have only one reason to change.
4. Classes are about behaviour and functionality.

# Analysis and Design
1. Well-designed software is easy to change and extend.
2. Use OO principles like encapsulation and inheritance to make the software more flexible.
3. If a design isn't flexible, then CHANGE IT!
4. Make sure each of your classes is cohesive: Each of your classes should focus on doing ONE THING really well.
5. Always strive for higher cohesion as you move through your software design life cycle.

# Solving Big Problems #
1. Listen to the customer and figure out what they want to build.
2. Put together a feature list, in language the customer understands.
3. Make sure the features are what the customers actually  really want.
3. Create Use case diagrams.
4. Break the big system up into lots of smaller sections.
5. Apply design pattern to the smaller sections.
6. Use basic OOA&D principles to design and code each smaller section.

# 3 Qs of archtecture #
1. Is it part of the essence of the system?
2. What does it mean?
3. How do i do it?

# 3 steps #
1. Ask the customer (what does the feature mean?)
2. Commonality analysis
3. Implementation plan (How do i realize that feature in my system?)

# Design Principles #
1. The open-closed principle (OCP).
2. Don't repeat yourself principle (DRY).
